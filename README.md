## Automatic Detection of deployment template files

By default, the extension recognizes a .json or .jsonc file as a deployment template file based on the $schema specified in the file (for instance, ```https://schema.management.azure.com/schemas/2018-05-01/deploymentTemplate.json#```) and will switch the editor language to "Azure Resource Manager Template" automatically.  If you do not want that behavior, you can set the ```azureResourceManagerTools.autoDetectJsonTemplates``` setting to false and use the below methods to determine which files to treat as deployment templates.

Besides automatic detection, you also use the ```files.associations``` setting to set up your own specific mappings based on specific files paths or patterns to mark them as deployment templates, e.g.

```json
    "files.associations": {
        "*.azrm.json": "arm-template" // Treat these files as deployment templates
    }
```
