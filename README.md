[![Version](https://vsmarketplacebadge.apphb.com/version/msazurermtools.azurerm-vscode-tools.svg)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=msazurermtools.azurerm-vscode-tools) [![Installs](https://vsmarketplacebadge.apphb.com/installs-short/msazurermtools.azurerm-vscode-tools.svg)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=msazurermtools.azurerm-vscode-tools) [![Build Status](https://dev.azure.com/ms-azuretools/AzCode/_apis/build/status/vscode-azurearmtools)](https://dev.azure.com/ms-azuretools/AzCode/_build/latest?definitionId=10)

This extension provides language support for Azure Resource Manager deployment templates and template language expressions.

## Features

- Provides a language server that understands Azure Resource Manager deployment template files
- ARM Template Outline view for easy navigation through large templates
- Colorization for Template Language Expressions (TLE)
- Analyze and validate JSON syntax, JSON schema conformance for Azure resources, string expressions issues that would affect deployment
  - **NEW in 0.8.0!** Our new language server now has a better understanding of Azure Resource Manager templates and can therefore provide a better error and completion experience beyond that provided using standard JSON validation
    - It narrows down its schema validation based on the resource type and apiVersion properties of each resource.
    - No longer suggests changing the resource type if the apiVersion is not supported, or if a property is missing or invalid (as tools using standard JSON validation would do)
    - Errors provide better guidance for what actually needs to be fixed in each resource to match the schema
    - Greatly improved completion speed
    - Greatly reduced memory usage
    - Schema validation now is case-insensitive and follows other conventions matching the Azure Resource Manager backend's behavior
    - Note: The Azure schemas (which are read and interpreted by this extension) are undergoing continual improvement
- IntelliSense for string expressions

- Snippets
  Just type `arm` in the editor to see the available snippets

  - Getting started with a new JSON/JSONC file

    - `arm!` - Adds the framework for a full deployment template file for resource group deployments

      If you have not turned off auto detection of template files, you will now have access to all the snippets for "Azure Resource Manager Template" files

    - `arm!s` - Adds the framework for a full deployment template file for subscription deployments

    - `arm!mg` - Adds the framework for a full deployment template file for management group deployments

    - `arm!t` - Adds the framework for a full deployment template file for tenant deployments

    - `armp!` - Adds the framework for a full deployment template parameters file

      Then you can use the `arm-param-value` snippet to add new parameter values for deployment

  - For existing Azure Resource Manage Template files
    - `arm-param`, `arm-variable`, `arm-userfunc`, `arm-userfunc-namespace`
      Add new parameters, variables, user functions and user namespaces.
    - Resources - type `arm-` to see the other 70+ snippets for creating new resources of various types. For example, type `arm-ubuntu` to add all five resources necessary for a basic Ubuntu virtual machine.

## Automatic Detection of deployment template files

By default, the extension recognizes a .json or .jsonc file as a deployment template file based on the \$schema specified in the file (for instance, `https://schema.management.azure.com/schemas/2018-05-01/deploymentTemplate.json#`) and will switch the editor language to "Azure Resource Manager Template" automatically. If you do not want that behavior, you can set the `azureResourceManagerTools.autoDetectJsonTemplates` setting to false and use the below methods to determine which files to treat as deployment templates.

Besides automatic detection, you can also use the `files.associations` setting to set up your own specific mappings based on specific files paths or patterns to mark them as deployment templates, e.g.

```json
    "files.associations": {
        "*.azrm.json": "arm-template" // Treat these files as deployment templates
    }
```
